PAMverse functionality for soundscape analysis provides analysts with a set of easy use standard visualizations to summarize soundscape data and integrate them with environmental or other data streams. The soundscape explorer shiny app provides a way to interactively view various figures of your own data, apply filters or customizations, and copy the code to recreate that figure in your own analysis script. An overview of the figures currently available and their customizations are included below.
