PAMverse functionality for soundscape analysis provides analysts with a set of easy use standard visualizations to summarize soundscape data and integrate them with environmental or other data streams. The soundscape explorer shiny app provides a way to interactively view various figures of your own data, apply filters or customizations, and copy the code to recreate that figure in your own analysis script.
