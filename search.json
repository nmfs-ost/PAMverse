    "text": "The PAMverse is a collection of open source R packages developed by Taiki Sakai to facilitate the analysis of passive acoustic data and the creation of standardized data products that summarize large datasets. Focal areas include a QA/QC tool, soundscape visualizations, acoustic detection summaries, and integration of multiple data types. Many of the PAMverse tools use Shiny apps as an easy way to explore possible figures, experiment with different plot settings, access code chunks to seamlessly customize a figure to your needs, or annotate data quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PAMverse consists of three R packages:\n\nPAMscapes: Functionality includes the QAQC tools as well as the analytical and visualization functions for soundscapes, acoustic detections, and integrative products. Most of the recent developments from the PAM SI are included here.\nPAMmisc: A collection of helper functions that support the other packages including loading environmental data that aligns with a given dataset.\nPAMpam: A collection of functions that work directly with PAMGuard data.\n\n\nIntegration with other PAM SI developments\nThe overarching goal of the PAM SI is to create a standardized, cloud-based, and open source workflow for the analysis of passive acoustic data. The PAMverse provides the standardized and open source data products that can be used in conservation and management contexts as a decision support tool.\nWhile PAMverse tools provide as much flexibility to the users as possible, using these tools in tandem with other PAM SI developments provides the most seamless user experience. For example, detection data exported from the Makara database will be automatically formatted in a way to seamlessly use as inputs to PAMverse functions for plot generation. Datasets not exported from Makara are still functional with these tools, but may require some reformatting.\n\n\n\nInstalling PAMverse packages\n\n\nPAMverse Demo",

In this example, we will want the following categories: “PAM Gliders”, “Drifting Recorders”, “Towed Arrays”, and “Handheld Hydrophones”.\n\nUsing the Source editor, use # to indicate Heading 1 style, ## for Heading 2 Style, etc.\nUsing the Visual editor, use the dropdown menu to select the Heading Style\n\nAdd Content. Most content will consist of text, with some images, hyperlinks, and occasional tables. To start, we recommend identifying the content you would like to put in there, and identify the Point of Contact (POC). As an example, we may put the following text:\nPOC: Jane Doe. General description of Hardware, links to online content (vendor specification page, relevant online content), instructions for build or maintain hardware (or links to that information), links to inventory, etc.\nOnce your outline is developed, fill in the content.
